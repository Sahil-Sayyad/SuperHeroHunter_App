# Superhero Hunter App using Vanilla JavaScript

    -This is a repository for Superhero Hunter App  Developed using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
    -It is developed to create a soothing Experience with powerful features and clean interface.
    -In this project we use Marvel API to fetch data of any hero/villian by searching its name in the search bar.
    -User can get more information about them by clicking on the name and add the character to their favorites list by clicking on the   heart    icon.
    -This project stores the favorite characters in the local storage so the result stays unchanged.

# Problem Statement

  Create a superhero hunter app. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks are allowed for Javascript (you can use any CSS   framework like Bootstrap).
  <br>

# Features Required

- <b>Home Page</b><br>

   - Fetch and display a list of SuperHeros (Characters) on the home page. Also create a search bar that will filter out the character based    on search query. Suppose I type “bat” in the search box, it should show “batman”. 
   [ API example https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/characters?ts=<time-stamp>&apikey=<public-key>&   hash=<md5(ts+privateKey+publicKey)>]

  -  Each search result of the superhero should have a favorite button, clicking on which superhero should be added to “My favorite  superheroes” (a list).

  - On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).


- <b>Superhero Page</b> <br>
